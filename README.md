## About  

This markdown file has been made to demonstrate deployment with GitHub Pages and how to write markdown.    

## Growth Mindset  
>For me - A _**Growth Mindset**_ is a state of mind in which you are open and enthusiastic towards learning. While understanding that *GROWTH* involves challenges and obstacles, it ultimately results in improvement and progress.

To maintain a growth mindest I will:
1. Review my progress regularly, remembering how much I knew on day one.
2. Seek Feedback from mentors and peers
3. Keep in mind that everything I **DON'T** know... I don't know _**yet**_
