#Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

you can change the properties of a CONST's properties

key value pairs - a property name and its value

The const keyword in front of an object implies that there is an object, and you're working with references to alter it. It also (correctly) implies that you should not attempt to reassign references to this object.

const obj = {a: 'foo', b: 'bar'};

const obj2 = {z: 'baz'};

obj = obj2; // const will prevent this operation.
const does not imply that the object properties should not be altered. It does imply that you should not try to change the reference.
